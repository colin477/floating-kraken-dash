# EZ Eatin' MVP Product Requirements Document

## 1. Summary

EZ Eatin' is an AI-driven mobile application designed to assist busy families, especially those on a budget, in identifying, planning meals efficiently and reducing grocery costs. The base app generates personalized meals/recipes via pictures of grocery receipts and available ingredients, creating a "virtual pantry" system that recommends recipes based on purchased items. Users can also take pictures of fully prepared meals, and the AI will extract ingredients, quantities, and cooking methods to reverse-engineer complete recipes. Further functionality allows families to plan meals based on user-defined tastes, dietary restrictions, local grocery deals, and budget limits. The app aims to minimize food waste and optimize grocery spending by providing shopping lists organized by store and price, with integrated purchasing capabilities through connected grocery pick-up and delivery services.

## 2. Problem & Goal

**Problem:** Busy, budget-conscious families struggle with decision fatigue (i.e., I have 20 minutes, what can I make now?) and time-consuming meal planning and often overspend on groceries due to a lack of awareness of local deals and inefficient shopping habits. This leads to increased stress, food waste and financial strain.

**Goal:** EZ Eatin' aims to:
- Reduce decision fatigue and make meal planning fun!
- Simplify meal planning for busy families, making it a quick 5-minute weekly routine
- Reduce grocery costs by 20-30% through local price optimization

- Users will find value in receipt processing and meal photo analysis features

## 9. AI Considerations

**Data Sources:** EZ Eatin' will utilize user-provided dietary restrictions and budget, real-time local grocery price data, comprehensive recipe databases, receipt image data, and prepared meal image data. It may also leverage internal knowledge from pre-training on nutritional information and cooking techniques.

**Model Selection:** For the MVP, a robust large language model (LLM) combined with specialized computer vision models for receipt and meal photo processing, and specialized algorithms for price optimization and recipe generation will be employed.

**Model Behavior Expectations:** EZ Eatin's AI should act as a helpful and intelligent personal assistant for meal planning. It should prioritize user health and budget goals, provide clear and concise suggestions, and be adaptable to user feedback. The AI should focus on providing practical, actionable meal plans and shopping lists, emphasizing efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The computer vision components should accurately extract information from receipts and meals while maintaining user privacy and data security.

## 10. Future Functionality: 3rd Party Data Sharing

This section outlines planned features for future releases that are not part of the core MVP. These capabilities focus on leveraging anonymized user data to create new value propositions and revenue streams through partnerships with third-party organizations. Implementation will be contingent on a strict user opt-in policy and a transparent data privacy framework.

### 10.1 Data Sharing Capabilities

The application will be designed with the future capability to share specific, anonymized user data with trusted third-party partners. The data types earmarked for potential sharing include:

-   **Meal & Food Data:** Anonymized data on popular meals, ingredient combinations, and food consumption patterns.
    -   *Potential Use Case:* Food brands and market research firms could use this data to understand consumer trends and preferences.
-   **Image & Photo Data:** Anonymized collections of photographed meals and ingredients.
    -   *Potential Use Case:* AI and machine learning companies could use this data to train and improve computer vision models for food recognition.
-   **Shopping Behavior & Timing Data:** Aggregated, anonymized data on when users are planning shopping trips and purchasing groceries through the app.
    -   *Potential Use Case:* Grocery retailers and delivery services could use this data to optimize staffing, inventory, and delivery logistics.
-   **Behavioral Trend Data:** Anonymized insights into changes in users' eating habits, dietary choices, and adoption of new food trends over time.
    -   *Potential Use Case:* Public health organizations and wellness companies could use this data to analyze population-level dietary trends.

### 10.2 Privacy Considerations & User Control

The implementation of any data sharing functionality will be governed by the following principles:

-   **Explicit Opt-In:** Users must provide explicit consent before any of their data is included in anonymized datasets for sharing. This will not be a default setting.
-   **Data Anonymization:** All shared data will be fully anonymized and aggregated to ensure that no personally identifiable information (PII) is ever exposed.
-   **Transparency:** Users will have access to clear, easy-to-understand documentation explaining what data may be shared, how it is anonymized, and with what types of partners.
-   **User Control:** Users will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out of data sharing programs at any time through their account settings without affecting their core app experience.
