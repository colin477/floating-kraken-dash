## üö® Issues Identified

### Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **Missing Custom Filter Endpoints** (404 errors)
   - `/api/v1/leftovers/filters` (POST/GET) - Not implemented
   - **Impact:** Low - Basic suggestion functionality works
   - **Recommendation:** Implement in future sprint if needed

2. **Missing Debug Endpoint** (404 error)
   - `/api/v1/leftovers/debug/matching-details` - Not implemented
   - **Impact:** Low - Core functionality unaffected
   - **Recommendation:** Implement for development/debugging purposes

3. **HTTP Status Code Inconsistency**
   - Some endpoints return 403 instead of 401 for unauthenticated requests
   - **Impact:** Very Low - Functionality works correctly
   - **Recommendation:** Standardize status codes for consistency

4. **Test Data Limitation**
   - No recipes in database for comprehensive leftover testing
   - **Impact:** Low - Algorithm logic is sound
   - **Recommendation:** Add sample recipes for more thorough testing
